## Project Overview

Heathify is a store application in which users are incentivized to purchase healthier options within the store's stock to obtain points; when enough points are earned, they may cash in said points for discounts and or free items within the store.

Our goal is to encourage people to improve their eating habits. Since there are very few incentives monetarily wise to purchase and eat healthy items, our application will remedy that by making it more beneficial for a user to purchase healthier options.
